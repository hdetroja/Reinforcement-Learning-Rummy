# Reinforcement-Learning-for-Rummy

We will implement Reinforcement Learning algorithm on Rummy game. We will understand and train a RL agent using SARSA or Q Learning. We will select one of the model for experiment, then use the various parameters on the selected model and choose the best parameters for final training of the RL agent. Finally, we will visualize and explain the results. We have implemented rummy here, Rummy is mostly played by 4 players where each player get 10 cards and rest of placed as closed deck. But for this assignment to keep it simple, we have changed some rules, reduced the deck of cards and distribution of the cards among each player. Otherwise, the our Q table would be large to handle on our local machines.
